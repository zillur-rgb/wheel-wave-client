## Overview

The task was to create an app for an Independent Service Provider. I have chosen website for Lawyer and the name I have chosen Law Art.

### The challenge and How it works

- Most time consuming challenge was to find a niche. It took me so long to find my niche.
- There is a homepage where a navigation bar which will be used for login and also navigate to different route.
- There is a service section where the services lawyer provides are listed and user can book an appointment for a particular service by clicking on the button.
- For booking an appointment user must do the sign in process so if user clicks on the book an appointment it will navigate to the signin page unless the user is already signed in.
- From sign in page if an user doesn't have an account, he/ she can go to signup page and complete the sign up.
- User can sign in using email and password or using his / her google account.
- Once he / she signs up, the page will be redirected to the checkout page.
